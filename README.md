# Todo App using React and .NET Core

A demo project using React in FE and .NET Core in BE

# Build & Run Project

Using Visual Studio, Open the solution `.sln` and press the `run` button! As easy as it says.

# Navigating through the project

The React project runs by default on http://localhost:44441 (Default port of proxy is 5210). If you would like to take a look at the endpoints, Swagger is served on http://localhost:5210/swagger.

# Test Endpoints

`TodoApp.http` is useful to test Endpoints from VS Code or any other preferred IDE. Swagger can be used for this goal as well. React app can be tested by `npm test` from CLI.
